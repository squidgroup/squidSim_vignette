[["index.html", "The {squidSim} R Package Vignette The {squidSim} R package", " The {squidSim} R Package Vignette Joel Pick 2024-12-11 The {squidSim} R package The {squidSim} R package is designed to simplify data simulation from a highly flexible set of models, including: Correlated and interacting predictor variables Non-Gaussian response variables (Poisson and binomial) Crossed and nested hierarchical structures Random intercepts and slopes Univariate and multivariate data Within level-specific residual variance (DHGLMs) Additive genetic effects (animal models) Phylogenetic effects with different models of evolution Temporal and spatial autocorrelation Missing data (MNAR, MAR and MCAR) Temporal sampling The main idea is that anything you can model using a linear mixed effect model framework (assuming underlying multivariate normality) you can simulate using the {squidSim} package. Why use {squidSim}? Starting with simulations can seem like a daunting task. The {squidSim} R package is designed to facilitate that transition, and to focus attention on the data structure and parameters needed for simulation, rather than programming knowledge. {squidSim} also provides a useful tool for experienced programmers. One problematic aspect of collaborative coding (or reviewing someone else’s code) is that many people have very contrasting programming styles. A major motivation for the {squidSim} package is that it provides a consistent framework for simulations, which can be interpreted by many people rather than having to decipher someone’s personal code. Using the vignette If you are new to using the {squidSim} package, we recommend that you read Sections 1 and 2 to familiarise yourself with the {squidSim} package before moving onto the more advanced topics. The later sections assume an certain level of understanding of how the functions work. The vignette assumes that you have a working knowledge of R, in particular being comfortable using vectors, matrices and lists. Installation The {squidSim} package is currently only available on github: devtools::install_github(&quot;squidgroup/squidSim&quot;) library(squidSim) Issues and bugs It would be great if you could report any suggestions, issues or bugs; here for issues relating to the package, and here for issues relating to this vignette. It is worth checking to see if anyone else has a similar problem first, and adding comments to their issue, before starting a new one. "],["simulate_population-function.html", "simulate_population() function", " simulate_population() function The heart of the {squidSim} R package is the simulate_population() function, which we can use to simulate hierarchical, population level data. We provide the function with a set of parameters, a hierarchical data structure (if we are simulating hierarchical data), and various other optional arguments, which are listed below. The simulate_population() function simulates predictors at each hierarchical level, using provided mean and variance-covariance (vcov) parameters, from a multivariate normal distribution. These predictors are then scaled by the beta parameters, and added together to create the response. The arguments that can be provided to the simulate_population() function (along with their defaults) are: simulate_population( data_structure, n, parameters, n_response=1, response_names, family=&quot;gaussian&quot;, link=&quot;identity&quot;, model, known_predictors, pedigree, pedigree_type, phylogeny, phylogeny_type, cov_str, sample_type, sample_param, n_pop=1 ) Each of these will be covered in more detail in the following sections. Briefly, n and data_structure refer to the size and structure of the data being simulated - data_structure is covered in more detail in Section 2. parameters is a list of parameters to be used in the simulation and is described in detail in Section 1. n_response refers the number of response variable to be simulated and is covered in detail in the section on multivariate models (Section 3). response_names controls what the simulated response variables are named, and is described in Sections 1 and 3. family and link refer to simulating non Gaussian response variables and are covered in Section 1.6. model allows for the specification of more complex models and is covered in Section 1.7. known_predictors allows for existing data to be incorporated into the simulations and is covered in 1.5. pedigree and pedigree_type relate to simulating genetic effects and are covered in Section 4, phylogeny and phylogeny_type, relate to simulating phylogenetic effects and are covered in Section 5 and cov_str relates to simulating a general covariance structure and is covered in multiple sections, including 4, 5, 6.3 and 6.4. sample_type and sample_param relate to different sampling methods and are covered in Section 7 n_pop relates to the number of populations, or datasets, that you want to simulate for each parameter set. This is covered in Section 1.8.

For the sake of clarity we have outlined everything here.

First we can write out all the different variables: \\(y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1,i} + \\beta_2 x_{2,i} + \\beta_3 x_{3,i} + \\epsilon_i\\) where each observation (denoted by the index \\(i\\)) of our response variable (\\(y_i\\)) is the sum of an intercept (\\(\\beta_0\\); value of the response when the predictor variables are all 0), the associated value of our predictor variables (\\(x_{1i}\\), \\(x_{2i}\\), \\(x_{3i}\\); which also vary at the level of the observation), each with a certain magnitude and direction of their effect (effect size or slope; \\(\\beta_1\\) etc), and some unexplained, residual variation (\\(\\epsilon_i\\)). We can also write this in matrix notation: \\(\\boldsymbol{y} = X\\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\\) where \\(X\\) is a matrix of predictors and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) is a (column) vector of slopes/effect sizes. This matrix notation is a bit more compact and relates most easily the structure of the simulate_population() function. However it becomes more complex when we have things varying at different levels, as we have to start getting design matrices for the random effects involved e.g. \\(\\boldsymbol{y} = X\\boldsymbol{\\beta} + Z\\boldsymbol{u} + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\\) which we would rather avoid here as it has little relation to the squidSim code. We can therefore combine the index and matrix notation. This is maybe a little more complex, but it’s compact and flexible and relates well to the simulate_population() function. \\(y_{i} = \\beta_0 + \\boldsymbol{x}_{i} \\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\epsilon_{i}\\) where \\(\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}\\) is the \\(i\\)th row of \\(X\\). I have deliberately separated the intercept (\\(\\beta_0\\)) out here, for the purpose of comparing with the structure of simulate_population(). Then for models that have predictors vary at different levels we can have \\(y_{ij} = \\beta_0 + \\boldsymbol{x}_{i} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_x + \\boldsymbol{u}_j \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_u + \\epsilon_{ij}\\) Instead of having predictors at different levels, we might have ‘random effects’ \\(y_{ij} = \\beta_0 + \\boldsymbol{x}_{i} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_x + u_j + \\epsilon_{ij}\\) at multiple levels \\(y_{ijk} = \\beta_0 + \\boldsymbol{x}_{i} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_x + u_j + w_k + \\epsilon_{ijk}\\) Distributions We can write distribution equations as: \\(x_{1i} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\) or \\(\\boldsymbol{x}_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_x, \\Sigma_x)\\) Interactions / Random regression \\(y_{ij} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_{i} + u_{1j} + x_{i}u_{2j} + \\epsilon_{ij}\\) \\(x_{i} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_x, \\sigma^2_x)\\) \\(\\boldsymbol{u}_j \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\Sigma_u)\\) \\(\\epsilon_{ij} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2_{\\epsilon})\\) Multi-response \\(\\boldsymbol{y}_{ij} = \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_0 + \\boldsymbol{x}_{i} B_x + \\boldsymbol{u}_j + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}_{ij}\\) \\(\\boldsymbol{x}_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_x, \\Sigma_x)\\) \\(\\boldsymbol{u}_j \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\Sigma_u)\\) \\(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}_{ij} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\Sigma_{\\epsilon})\\) where \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_0\\) is a vector of intercepts of length q (number of responses) \\(B\\) is a \\(p*q\\) (p - number of predictors) matrix of \\(\\beta\\)s "],["1-linearmod.html", "1 Simulating from linear models", " 1 Simulating from linear models In this section, we will look at simulating simple data from linear models, to familiarise ourselves with how {squidSim} works. "],["1.1-simple-linear-model.html", "1.1 Simple Linear Model", " 1.1 Simple Linear Model We will start simulating data without any hierarchical structure, i.e. everything varies at the level of the observation. Let’s imagine a situation where body mass is affected by some environmental variables - temperature, rainfall and wind. We can write this out in the form of a linear model: \\[ y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1i} + \\beta_2 x_{2i} + \\beta_3 x_{3i} + \\epsilon_i \\] , where each observation (denoted by the index \\(i\\)) of our response variable (\\(y_i\\)) is the sum of an intercept (\\(\\beta_0\\); value of the response when the predictor variables are all 0), the associated value of our predictor variables (\\(x_{1i}\\), \\(x_{2i}\\), \\(x_{3i}\\); which also vary at the level of the observation), each with a certain magnitude and direction of their effect (effect size or slope; \\(\\beta_1\\) etc), and some unexplained, residual variation (\\(\\epsilon_i\\)). We can write this in more compact notation, \\[ y_{i} = \\beta_0 + \\boldsymbol{x}_{i} \\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\epsilon_{i} \\] where \\(\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}\\) is a (row) vector of \\(x_{1i}\\), \\(x_{2i}\\) \\(x_{3i}\\) etc, or equivalently row \\(i\\) in the matrix of predictors \\(X\\), \\[ \\boldsymbol{x}_{i} = \\begin{bmatrix} x_{1i} &amp; x_{2i} &amp; x_{3i} \\end{bmatrix} \\] and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) is a (column) vector of slopes/effect sizes \\[ \\boldsymbol{\\beta} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\beta_1 \\\\ \\beta_2 \\\\ \\beta_3 \\end{bmatrix} \\] We will use this notation throughout the vignette, as it is a bit more compact, relates most easily the structure of the simulate_population() function, and can incorporate the flexibility needed for the different model structures. We assume that these predictor variables are multivariate normally distributed, with given means (\\(\\mu\\)) and a covariance structure (\\(\\Sigma_x\\)), and the residuals are normally distributed with a given variance (\\(\\sigma^2_\\epsilon\\)) \\[ \\boldsymbol{x}_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_x, \\Sigma_x) \\] \\[ \\epsilon_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^2_\\epsilon) \\] where \\[ \\boldsymbol{\\mu}_x = \\begin{bmatrix} \\mu_{x_1} \\\\ \\mu_{x_2} \\\\ \\mu_{x_3} \\end{bmatrix} , \\Sigma_x = \\begin{bmatrix} \\sigma^2_{x_1} &amp; \\sigma_{x_1x_2} &amp; \\sigma_{x_1x_3}\\\\ \\sigma_{x_1x_2} &amp; \\sigma^2_{x_2} &amp; \\sigma_{x_2x_3}\\\\ \\sigma_{x_1x_3} &amp; \\sigma_{x_2x_3} &amp; \\sigma^2_{x_3} \\end{bmatrix} \\] The key to simulating data using the squidSim package is correctly specifying the parameters (from the equations above that would be \\(\\beta_0\\), \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\), \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_x\\), \\(\\Sigma_x\\), \\(\\sigma^2_\\epsilon\\)). These parameters are given to the simulate_population function as a nested list. Within the main parameter list, there are named lists corresponding to different hierarchical levels, containing the parameters for the predictors at that level - here we are just focussing on the observation level (see Section 2 for examples with hierarchical structure). Parameters for the residual must be specified, all other levels are optional (they revert to defaults values; beta=1, mean=0, vcov=1. In addition to the named lists relating to hierarchical levels, a vector for intercepts and a list for interactions can be added. Intercepts are demonstrated in the examples below, and interactions in Section 1.3. Many of the components in the parameter list don’t need to be specified and default values will be created. Let’s simulate from the above model. First, we can specify a sample size or data_structure. As we don’t have any hierarchical data structure yet (see Section 2), we have to specify the sample size with the n argument to the simulate_population function (e.g. 2000). simulate_population( n=2000, ... ) We can also give the response (\\(\\boldsymbol{y}\\)) variable a name, body_mass (this is not needed, and defaults to y if not specified). simulate_population( n=2000, response_name = &quot;body_mass&quot;, ... ) We then need to add in our parameter list: simulate_population( n=2000, response_name = &quot;body_mass&quot;, parameters = list( ... ) ) To fill in our parameter list, lets think about our model \\[ y_{i} = \\color{red}{\\beta_0}+ \\color{blue}{\\boldsymbol{x}_{i} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}} + \\color{orange}{\\epsilon_{i}} \\] \\[ \\boldsymbol{x}_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_x, \\Sigma_x) \\] \\[ \\epsilon_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^2_\\epsilon) \\] or in words: intercept + observation level predictors + residual These names correspond to names in our parameter list. To simulate our environmental predictors that vary at the level of the observation, we can use the observation slot in the parameter list, as well as specifying an intercept and residual variance in the intercept and residual slots, respectively. The global intercept (\\(\\beta_0\\)) is given by specifying an intercept vector in the parameter list e.g. intercept=10 For both observation and residual we create a list containing the respective parameters. For the observation list, we can specify the names of these variables as a vector (these can be anything - I like giving things actual names, but could also be x1, x2 and x3) and, in the simplest case, the \\(\\beta\\) values as a vector. observation = list( names = c(&quot;temperature&quot;,&quot;rainfall&quot;, &quot;wind&quot;), beta = c(0.5,-0.3, 0.4) ) By default, these predictors are simulated as i.i.d. unit normals (mean=0, var=1, cov=0), so \\[ \\boldsymbol{\\mu}_x = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} , \\Sigma_x = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\] Note that the order of the names and betas has to match. We can then specify the residual variance, here as 0.8 (but can be anything). vcov refers to the variance-covariance matrix, which for the residuals is only a single variance until we have multiple response variables (Section 3). residual = list( vcov = 0.8 ) We can then put this all together: squid_data &lt;- simulate_population( n=2000, response_name = &quot;body_mass&quot;, parameters = list( intercept=10, observation = list( names = c(&quot;temperature&quot;,&quot;rainfall&quot;, &quot;wind&quot;), beta = c(0.5,-0.3, 0.4) ), residual = list( vcov = 0.8 ) ) ) Let’s compare the code back to the model using colors to link equation to code: \\[ y_{i} = \\color{red}{\\beta_0}+ \\color{blue}{\\boldsymbol{x}_{i} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}} + \\color{orange}{\\epsilon_{i}} \\] \\[ \\color{blue}{\\boldsymbol{x}_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_x, \\Sigma_x)} \\] \\[ \\color{orange}{\\epsilon_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^2_\\epsilon)} \\] This generates a squid object, which when run returns a friendly message: squid_data ## Data simulated using squid ## ## /\\ ## / \\ ## / /\\ \\ ## \\/ \\/ ## / \\ ## | | ## | | ## 0 | | 0 ## / \\____/ \\ ## { __/( )\\__ } ## \\___/__\\_\\/_/__\\___/ ## / / / / \\ \\ \\ \\ ## / / / { } \\ \\ \\ ## { { / \\ / \\ } } ## } \\ 0 0 / { ## 0_/ { \\_0 0_/ } \\_0 ## \\ / ## } { ## / \\ ## 0 0 and contains all our simulation parameters as well as the simulated data. At this point we want to be able to access the simulated data. There are then some further functions which we can use to access the data and simulation parameters. We can extract the simulated data using get_population_data() The generated response is returned, along with simulated predictors and the data structure (not relevant here). data &lt;- get_population_data(squid_data) head(data) ## body_mass temperature rainfall wind residual squid_pop ## 1 9.809451 -0.5478939 0.20508206 0.1508594 0.08457911 1 ## 2 6.726013 0.1829981 1.46962434 -1.2879690 -2.40941140 1 ## 3 9.811235 -0.8048619 -0.16589518 0.1486768 0.10442629 1 ## 4 7.985417 -1.9522468 -1.23337257 -1.8210313 -0.68005930 1 ## 5 8.161597 0.2863420 0.09892012 -0.3421751 -1.81502750 1 ## 6 10.372638 0.9476735 1.55338036 0.4065158 0.20220909 1 Later on we will explore how to simulate data for multiple populations with the same parameters (Section 1.8). squid_pop is an identifier for the population number, but is not relevant here.

That is to be expected - simulation involves randomly generating data, which means that here will be stochasticity in the simulated sample, and in our estimates of the underlying parameters. 1.1.1 Adding more information about the predictors We can also specify the predictors as having different means and variances. In the observation list, mean and vcov specify the means and covariance matrix of the predictors. If the predictors were uncorrelated, we can just specify the variances as a vector (the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix), and the function assumes the covariances are 0 (see section 1.2 for correlated predictors). Below we have three predictors, temperature, rainfall and wind, with means 10, 1 and 20 respectively, variances 1, 0.1 and 2, respectively, and betas 0.5,-3 and 0.4, a residual variance 0.8 and a global intercept of 10: \\[ y_{i} = \\beta_0+ \\boldsymbol{x}_{i} \\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\epsilon_{i} \\] \\[ \\boldsymbol{x}_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_x, \\Sigma_x) \\] \\[ \\epsilon_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^2_\\epsilon) \\] \\[ \\color{red}{\\beta_0=10} , \\color{blue}{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_x = \\begin{bmatrix} 10 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 20 \\end{bmatrix}} , \\color{CornflowerBlue}{\\Sigma_x = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0.1 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 \\end{bmatrix}} , \\color{purple}{\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\\\ -3 \\\\ 0.4 \\end{bmatrix}} , \\color{orange}{\\sigma^2_\\epsilon=0.8} \\] data &lt;- get_population_data(squid_data) coef(lm(body_mass ~ temperature + rainfall + wind, data)) ## (Intercept) temperature rainfall wind ## 9.6936858 0.5277087 -3.0577425 0.4047932 library(scales) par(mfrow=c(1,3)) plot(body_mass ~ temperature + rainfall + wind, data, pch=19, cex=0.5, col=alpha(1,0.5)) Again, we can check that the means and variances of the predictors are being simulated as we think they should be predictors &lt;- data[,c(&quot;temperature&quot;,&quot;rainfall&quot;,&quot;wind&quot;)] colMeans(predictors) ## temperature rainfall wind ## 10.00240 1.00085 20.01790 cov(predictors) ## temperature rainfall wind ## temperature 0.990823966 -0.006253787 0.03013589 ## rainfall -0.006253787 0.098287391 -0.01134461 ## wind 0.030135886 -0.011344607 2.08443275 It can be complicated to keep up with how these different values combine to give the mean and variance of the response.

TheTri2M() function from the package MCMCglmm allows you to just give the lower or upper half of the matrix, and it will fill the rest out for you.

The correlation between these two variables represents the measurement error (the repeatability of the variable is the correlation squared).

For example, below we just assign names to the two sexes: make_structure(structure=&quot;sex(2)/individual(5)&quot;, repeat_obs=2, level_names=list(sex=c(&quot;female&quot;,&quot;male&quot;))) ## sex individual ## 1 female 1 ## 2 female 1 ## 3 female 2 ## 4 female 2 ## 5 female 3 ## 6 female 3 ## 7 female 4 ## 8 female 4 ## 9 female 5 ## 10 female 5 ## 11 male 6 ## 12 male 6 ## 13 male 7 ## 14 male 7 ## 15 male 8 ## 16 male 8 ## 17 male 9 ## 18 male 9 ## 19 male 10 ## 20 male 10 And then to the individuals and the sexes make_structure(structure=&quot;sex(2)/individual(5)&quot;, repeat_obs=2, level_names=list(sex=c(&quot;female&quot;,&quot;male&quot;),individual=paste0(&quot;ind_&quot;,1:10))) ## sex individual ## 1 female ind_1 ## 2 female ind_1 ## 3 female ind_2 ## 4 female ind_2 ## 5 female ind_3 ## 6 female ind_3 ## 7 female ind_4 ## 8 female ind_4 ## 9 female ind_5 ## 10 female ind_5 ## 11 male ind_6 ## 12 male ind_6 ## 13 male ind_7 ## 14 male ind_7 ## 15 male ind_8 ## 16 male ind_8 ## 17 male ind_9 ## 18 male ind_9 ## 19 male ind_10 ## 20 male ind_10 "],["2.2-factors.html", "2.2 Factors", " 2.2 Factors In the first sections, we just simulated continuous predictors, varying at the level of the observation. However, we may want to simulate factors with known or fixed effects (i.e. not variables drawn randomly from a particular distribution) at different levels, such as sex or treatment effects. The first thing we want to do is specify a simple data structure, for example 100 observations for each of two sexes: ds &lt;- make_structure(structure=&quot;sex(2)&quot;, repeat_obs=100, level_names=list(sex=c(&quot;female&quot;,&quot;male&quot;))) Then we feed this data structure into the simulate_population() function using the data_structure argument. Note that we no longer need to specify the sample size (n), as this is taken from the number of rows in the data_structure. squid_data &lt;- simulate_population( data_structure = ds, parameters = ... ) In order to tell the parameter list we have effects that vary at different hierarchical levels, we can create additional slots in the parameter list for the grouping factors, so now it will look something like: squid_data &lt;- simulate_population( data_structure = ds, parameters = list( intercept = ..., sex = list( ... ), observation = list( ... ), residual = list( ... ) ) ) The names in the parameter list that relate to the different grouping factors either need to match the name in the data structure exactly (as above) or a ‘group’ argument needs to be given e.g. squid_data &lt;- simulate_population( data_structure = ds, parameters = list( intercept = ..., anything = list( group=&quot;sex,&quot; ... ), observation = list( ... ), residual = list( ... ) ) ) We then need to tell the parameters list that we have fixed effects for this grouping factor, in other words we know the difference in body size between the sexes is 0.5, for example. To do this we specify fixed = TRUE. squid_data &lt;- simulate_population( data_structure = ds, parameters = list( intercept = ..., sex = list( fixed=TRUE, ... ), observation = list( ... ), residual = list( ... ) ) ) We can then give a beta for all the different levels of that group. Note that there are two ways to specify this, as there also is in linear models in R. First, we can specify an intercept, and contrasts, equivalent to the output of lm(body_mass~sex), which involves specifying the beta for the first level as 0 to make it the baseline level (or any other level that you would like to be the baseline). Note that, as of version 0.2.4, if the levels for this grouping factor in the data structure have names (in this case “male” and “female”), then the same names have to be specified in the parameter list. squid_data &lt;- simulate_population( data_structure = ds, parameters = list( intercept= 10, sex=list( fixed=TRUE, beta=c(0,0.5), names = c(&quot;female&quot;,&quot;male&quot;) ), residual = list( vcov = 0.5 ) ) ) data &lt;- get_population_data(squid_data) boxplot( y ~ factor(sex), data) lm( y ~ factor(sex), data) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = y ~ factor(sex), data = data) ## ## Coefficients: ## (Intercept) factor(sex)male ## 10.176 0.377 Alternately, we can specify no intercept (which defaults to 0), and the means for the two levels as betas( equivalent to lm(body_mass~0+sex)): squid_data &lt;- simulate_population( data_structure = ds, parameters = list( sex=list( fixed=TRUE, beta=c(10,10.5), names = c(&quot;female&quot;,&quot;male&quot;) ), residual = list( vcov = 0.5 ) ) ) data &lt;- get_population_data(squid_data) boxplot( y ~ factor(sex), data) lm( y ~ factor(sex), data) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = y ~ factor(sex), data = data) ## ## Coefficients: ## (Intercept) factor(sex)male ## 10.132 0.409 lm( y ~ 0+factor(sex), data) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = y ~ 0 + factor(sex), data = data) ## ## Coefficients: ## factor(sex)female factor(sex)male ## 10.13 10.54 We would recommend the former methods, as this makes things clearer if other factors are simulated. 2.2.1 Fixed Factor Interactions We might want to simulate an interaction between a continuous predictor and a factor, for example the effect of the environment varying between two sexes. Specifying this using simulate_population() is similar to interactions between two continuous predictors that we have previously encountered (Section 1.3). In the interaction part of the parameter list, we now specify the contrasts between the slopes for environment, using the names that we have assigned the different levels. In the simulation below, males are larger, and have a larger environment slope: squid_data &lt;- simulate_population( data_structure = make_structure(structure = &quot;sex(2)&quot;, repeat_obs=1000), parameters = list( intercept=10, sex=list( fixed=TRUE, names=c(&quot;female&quot;,&quot;male&quot;), beta=c(0,0.5) ), observation= list( names = c(&quot;environment&quot;), beta =c(0.2) ), interactions = list( names=c(&quot;environment:male&quot;), beta = 0.4 ), residual = list( names=&quot;residual&quot;, vcov = 0.1 ) ) ) data &lt;- get_population_data(squid_data) head(data) ## y female male environment residual environment:male sex squid_pop ## 1 9.750474 1 0 -1.25796735 0.002067288 0 1 1 ## 2 10.456740 1 0 -0.92214063 0.641167781 0 1 1 ## 3 10.327966 1 0 0.67783250 0.192399695 0 1 1 ## 4 9.976236 1 0 0.71095086 -0.165954375 0 1 1 ## 5 9.984801 1 0 -0.08647446 0.002095792 0 1 1 ## 6 10.295880 1 0 2.87982801 -0.280085298 0 1 1 plot(y~environment,data, pch=19, col=scales::alpha(c(1,2),0.5)[factor(data$sex)]) lm( y ~ 0 + factor(sex)*environment, data) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = y ~ 0 + factor(sex) * environment, data = data) ## ## Coefficients: ## factor(sex)1 factor(sex)2 environment ## 10.0031 10.4872 0.2023 ## factor(sex)2:environment ## 0.3867 "],["2.3-simulating-predictors-at-different-hierarchical-levels.html", "2.3 Simulating predictors at different hierarchical levels", " 2.3 Simulating predictors at different hierarchical levels As well as simulating continuous predictors at the level of the observation, we can also simulate predictors at different hierarchical levels. Let’s take the example of a situation where we have repeated measures of individuals. The individuals have traits that are consistently expressed, whilst the environment varies between observations. We can describe variation at these different hierarchical levels as: \\[ y_{ij} = \\beta_0 + \\boldsymbol{x}_{i} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_x + \\boldsymbol{u}_j \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_u + \\epsilon_{ij} \\] \\[ \\boldsymbol{x}_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_x, \\Sigma_x) \\] \\[ \\boldsymbol{u}_j \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_u, \\Sigma_u) \\] \\[ \\epsilon_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^2_\\epsilon) \\] where \\(U\\) is a matrix of predictors that vary at the individual level (denoted by the subscript \\(j\\)), and \\(X\\) is a matrix of predictors at the observation level (denoted by the index \\(i\\)). In order to simulate from this model, we need a data structure and parameters for each of these levels. To do this, we can either specify a data structure generated using make_structure (outlined previously in Section 2.1), or a pre-existing data structure, to the simulate_population function. We then add an item to the parameter list, the name of which matches on of the grouping factors in the data structure, and specify the parameters for predictors that vary at that level in the same way as outlined in the previous section (1). This is similar to the fixed factors above, but we are now assuming that the variable is drawn randomly from a distribution, rather than the effects at each level being fixed. Lets imagine that we simulate behaviour, that is a functions of an individual’s size and physiology, and also varies in response to the environment, here temperature and rainfall: squid_data &lt;- simulate_population( data_structure = make_structure(structure = &quot;individual(500)&quot;, repeat_obs=2), parameters = list( individual = list( names = c(&quot;size&quot;,&quot;physiology&quot;), beta = c(0.1,0.2) ), observation = list( names=c(&quot;temperature&quot;,&quot;rainfall&quot;), beta = c(0.2,-0.1) ), residual = list( vcov = 0.5 ) ), response_names=&quot;behaviour&quot; ) data &lt;- get_population_data(squid_data) coef(lm(behaviour ~ size + physiology + temperature + rainfall , data)) ## (Intercept) size physiology temperature rainfall ## -0.03402370 0.07313193 0.17416616 0.24872731 -0.11561841 Here, we have simulated 4 predictors, ‘size’ and ‘physiology’ that vary at the level of the individual, and ‘temperature’ and ‘rainfall’ that vary at the level of the observation. To keep things simple, we will simulate them all as unit normal variables (mean=0 and variance=1). Note, the names of the different grouping factors in the parameter list (here ‘individual’) needs to exactly match those in the data structure. The order does not, however, have to be the same. There are circumstances in which we may want to simulate two sets of effects at the same hierarchical level (for example see permanent environment effects in Section 4.1), in this case we can call them different things in the parameter list, but link them back to the grouping factor, by providing a group name. For example the following will produce the same simulation as above: squid_data &lt;- simulate_population( data_structure = make_structure(structure = &quot;individual(500)&quot;, repeat_obs=2), parameters = list( ind1 = list( group=&quot;individual&quot;, names = c(&quot;size&quot;), beta = c(0.1) ), ind2 = list( group=&quot;individual&quot;, names = c(&quot;physiology&quot;), beta = c(0.2) ), observation = list( names=c(&quot;temperature&quot;,&quot;rainfall&quot;), beta = c(0.2,-0.1) ), residual = list( vcov = 0.5 ) ), response_names=&quot;behaviour&quot; ) It is also worth noting that predictors do not have to be simulated for every grouping factor in the data structure - in this way no variation at that level can be simulated. 2.3.1 Simulating ‘random’ effects In essence, random effects (random intercepts) represent an unobserved/latent predictor (or group of predictors), which varies at a given hierarchical level. In a mixed effect model, the effect at each level of the grouping factor is unknown, and estimated by the model (and assumed to come from a normal distribution). When simulating this, however, we can simply simulate an additional predictor at a particular hierarchical level (\\(z\\)) with mean 0 and a given variance (\\(\\sigma^2_z\\)). \\[ y_{ij} = \\beta_0 + u_j + \\epsilon_{ij} \\] \\[ u_j \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^2_u) \\] \\[ \\epsilon_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^2_\\epsilon) \\] For example, we can simulate some among-individual variation as follows: squid_data &lt;- simulate_population( data_structure = make_structure(structure = &quot;individual(500)&quot;, repeat_obs=2), parameters = list( individual = list( vcov = 0.5 ), residual = list( vcov = 0.5 ) ) ) data &lt;- get_population_data(squid_data) head(data) ## y individual_effect residual individual squid_pop ## 1 0.602356146 0.1594673 0.4428889 1 1 ## 2 1.204485552 0.1594673 1.0450183 1 1 ## 3 -0.681867088 -0.3816181 -0.3002490 2 1 ## 4 -1.436016418 -0.3816181 -1.0543983 2 1 ## 5 0.006081218 0.7306521 -0.7245709 3 1 ## 6 0.177797638 0.7306521 -0.5528544 3 1 library(lme4) short_summary &lt;- function(x) print(summary(x), correlation=FALSE, show.resids=FALSE, ranef.comp = c(&quot;Variance&quot;)) short_summary(lmer(y ~ 1 + (1|individual), data)) ## Linear mixed model fit by REML [&#39;lmerMod&#39;] ## Formula: y ~ 1 + (1 | individual) ## Data: data ## ## REML criterion at convergence: 2694 ## ## Random effects: ## Groups Name Variance ## individual (Intercept) 0.4741 ## Residual 0.5103 ## Number of obs: 1000, groups: individual, 500 ## ## Fixed effects: ## Estimate Std.

For example, if we are simulating body mass, we might expect that body mass is a function of an environmental variable, rainfall, and that differs systematically among individuals, as well as within, for example due to spatial variation in where individual lives. The simplest way of simulating this is as two rainfall variables, one at the level of the individual and one at the level of the observation, something like: squid_data &lt;- simulate_population( data_structure=make_structure(&quot;individual(100)&quot;, repeat_obs=5), parameters = list( individual=list( names=c(&quot;between_rainfall&quot;), ... ), observation=list( names=c(&quot;within_rainfall&quot;), ... ), residual=list( ... ) ) ) We can then specify the variation in rainfall within and between individuals, for example, if the repeatability of rainfall amongst individuals is 0.5, and the total variance in rainfall is 0.8, we would make the variance in rainfall 0.4 at each level: squid_data &lt;- simulate_population( data_structure=make_structure(&quot;individual(100)&quot;, repeat_obs=5), parameters = list( individual=list( names=c(&quot;between_rainfall&quot;), vcov=0.4, ... ), observation=list( names=c(&quot;within_rainfall&quot;), vcov=0.4, ... ), residual=list( 0.8 ) ) ) If we want the rainfall variable to have a mean that is not 0, we should specify this in only one place, as otherwise they will add up weirdly! squid_data &lt;- simulate_population( data_structure=make_structure(&quot;individual(100)&quot;, repeat_obs=5), parameters = list( individual=list( names=c(&quot;between_rainfall&quot;), vcov=0.4, ... ), observation=list( names=c(&quot;within_rainfall&quot;), vcov=0.4, mean=10 ), residual=list( 0.8 ) ) ) Now we want to add in some betas.

By default, simulate_population() will add a number to the default name to indicate which reponse variable it refers to, so here we have y1 and y2 for the response variable, and individual_effect1 and individual_effect2 etc. data &lt;- get_population_data(squid_data) head(data) ## y1 y2 individual_effect1 individual_effect2 residual1 ## 1 1.1054644 1.4127080 2.480034 1.634281 -1.37456980 ## 2 4.1766734 0.8345915 2.480034 1.634281 1.69663917 ## 3 1.7790364 0.5872531 2.480034 1.634281 -0.70099782 ## 4 0.7353167 0.5515726 2.480034 1.634281 -1.74471750 ## 5 2.4911567 0.9464126 2.480034 1.634281 0.01112246 ## 6 5.1880032 3.3071899 2.480034 1.634281 2.70796900 ## residual2 individual squid_pop ## 1 -0.2215732 1 1 ## 2 -0.7996898 1 1 ## 3 -1.0470282 1 1 ## 4 -1.0827086 1 1 ## 5 -0.6878687 1 1 ## 6 1.6729086 1 1 We can name the response variables easily, by giving the response_name argument a vector of names squid_data &lt;- simulate_population( data_structure=make_structure(structure = &quot;individual(100)&quot;,repeat_obs=10), n_response = 2, response_name = c(&quot;body_mass&quot;,&quot;behaviour&quot;), parameters=list( individual = list( vcov = matrix(c(1,0.5,0.5,1),nrow=2,ncol=2,byrow=TRUE) ), residual = list( vcov = matrix(c(1,0.5,0.5,1),nrow = 2,ncol = 2,byrow=TRUE) ) ) ) data &lt;- get_population_data(squid_data) head(data) ## body_mass behaviour individual_effect1 individual_effect2 residual1 ## 1 -0.45333155 -2.3819621 -0.5478939 -0.09634067 0.09456232 ## 2 -0.43114173 -0.6964292 -0.5478939 -0.09634067 0.11675214 ## 3 -2.57715631 -0.9151838 -0.5478939 -0.09634067 -2.02926243 ## 4 -0.09299664 -0.1446033 -0.5478939 -0.09634067 0.45489723 ## 5 -0.92695565 1.2149131 -0.5478939 -0.09634067 -0.37906178 ## 6 -1.99656829 -0.6476084 -0.5478939 -0.09634067 -1.44867441 ## residual2 individual squid_pop ## 1 -2.28562139 1 1 ## 2 -0.60008852 1 1 ## 3 -0.81884311 1 1 ## 4 -0.04826266 1 1 ## 5 1.31125377 1 1 ## 6 -0.55126775 1 1 "],["3.1-predictors-affecting-multiple-responses.html", "3.1 Predictors affecting multiple responses", " 3.1 Predictors affecting multiple responses If we look a little at what simulate_population() assumes underneath with the formulation above (just random effects), we can understand more how we simulate predictors that affect multiple response variable. In the above code, we are essentially simulating a predictor for each trait (individual_effect1 and individual_effect2) with some covariance between them. We can expand the equation above: \\[\\boldsymbol{y}_{ij} = \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_0 + \\boldsymbol{u}_j B_u + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}_{ij}B_{\\epsilon}\\] \\[ B_u = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 \\end{bmatrix} , B_{\\epsilon} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\] to include matrices of \\(\\beta\\)s, \\(B\\), the columns of which refer to the response variable, and the rows predictors. In this case they are all identity matrices, which essentially controlling which predictors affects which response (\\(u_1\\) affects \\(y_1\\) but not \\(y_2\\) and vice versa). Internally, simulate_population() does the same thing, and assigns beta as an identity matrix. squid_data &lt;- simulate_population( data_structure= make_structure(structure = &quot;individual(100)&quot;,repeat_obs=10), n_response=2, response_name = c(&quot;body_mass&quot;,&quot;behaviour&quot;), parameters=list( individual = list( vcov =matrix(c(1,0.5,0.5,1),nrow=2,ncol=2,byrow=TRUE), beta= diag(2) ), residual = list( vcov =matrix(c(1,0.5,0.5,1),nrow=2,ncol=2,byrow=TRUE), beta= diag(2) ) ) ) How is this helpful? Well now we could simulate one (or many) predictor(s) that both responses. In the form of an equation we could have \\[\\boldsymbol{y}_{ij} = \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_0 + \\boldsymbol{x}_{i} B_x + \\boldsymbol{u}_j + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}_{ij}\\] \\[\\boldsymbol{x}_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_x, \\Sigma_x)\\] \\[\\boldsymbol{u}_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\Sigma_u)\\] \\[\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}_{i} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\Sigma_{\\epsilon})\\] where \\(B\\) is a \\(p*q\\) matrix, where \\(p\\) is number of predictors. So if we returned to our original example in Section 1, we have three predictors at the observation level - temperature, rainfall and wind. So \\(B_x\\) would be a 3*2 matrix, with 3 predictors and two responses. Beta &lt;- matrix(c( 0.5, -0.1, 0.2, -0.2, 0.3, -0.1 ),nrow=3,ncol=2,byrow=TRUE) Beta ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 0.5 -0.1 ## [2,] 0.2 -0.2 ## [3,] 0.3 -0.1 So here, the environment variables all positively affect body mass (response 1) and negatively affect behaviour (response 2). This then slots easily into our code. squid_data &lt;- simulate_population( data_structure= make_structure(structure = &quot;individual(100)&quot;,repeat_obs=20), n_response=2, parameters= list( individual = list( vcov =matrix(c(1,0.5,0.5,1),nrow=2,ncol=2,byrow=TRUE) ), observation = list( names = c(&quot;temperature&quot;, &quot;rainfall&quot;, &quot;wind&quot;), beta= Beta ), residual = list( vcov= matrix(c(1,0.5,0.5,1),nrow=2,ncol=2,byrow=TRUE) ) ) ) data &lt;- get_population_data(squid_data) head(data) ## y1 y2 individual_effect1 individual_effect2 temperature ## 1 0.2981452 -1.3155845 -0.311252 -0.897568 -1.1453264 ## 2 -0.6873794 -0.6087159 -0.311252 -0.897568 -0.8578652 ## 3 0.5970893 -0.6079079 -0.311252 -0.897568 -0.2261574 ## 4 -1.4274647 -1.3401883 -0.311252 -0.897568 1.8213830 ## 5 1.5506350 -0.6644989 -0.311252 -0.897568 1.1993774 ## 6 -0.3039953 -1.9789316 -0.311252 -0.897568 -1.2945405 ## rainfall wind residual1 residual2 individual squid_pop ## 1 0.5882671 1.1457965 0.7206679 -0.3003161 1 1 ## 2 0.2144061 -0.5558841 0.1766892 0.1903584 1 1 ## 3 1.6741909 0.5743441 0.5142786 0.6593169 1 1 ## 4 0.2989377 -0.8591160 -1.8289570 -0.2866060 1 1 ## 5 0.4251985 -0.2197198 1.2430745 0.4160745 1 1 ## 6 1.1467957 1.0675309 0.1049086 -0.8747054 1 1 # library(MCMCglmm) # mod &lt;- MCMCglmm(cbind(y1,y2)~1,random=~us(trait):individual, rcov=~us(trait):units,data=data,family=rep(&quot;gaussian&quot;,2),verbose=FALSE) # summary(mod) Equally if we want an interaction, we now have to expand the size of what we give to beta, with one \\(\\beta\\) for each response, in a matrix, with \\(q\\) columns. squid_data &lt;- simulate_population( data_structure= make_structure(structure = &quot;individual(100)&quot;,repeat_obs=20), n_response=2, parameters= list( individual = list( vcov =matrix(c(1,0.5,0.5,1),nrow=2,ncol=2,byrow=TRUE) ), observation = list( names = c(&quot;temperature&quot;, &quot;rainfall&quot;, &quot;wind&quot;), beta= Beta ), interactions = list( names = c(&quot;temperature:rainfall&quot;), beta=matrix(c(0.1,-0.3),ncol=2,byrow=TRUE) ), residual = list( vcov= matrix(c(1,0.5,0.5,1),nrow=2,ncol=2,byrow=TRUE) ) ) ) data &lt;- get_population_data(squid_data) head(data) ## y1 y2 individual_effect1 individual_effect2 temperature ## 1 -1.4752163 -0.53377659 -0.2872822 -0.6655179 0.03214917 ## 2 0.1289671 -0.83203811 -0.2872822 -0.6655179 -0.08320398 ## 3 0.7591382 -0.04450337 -0.2872822 -0.6655179 -0.28697095 ## 4 2.1132225 -1.23146725 -0.2872822 -0.6655179 1.92678408 ## 5 -0.8876520 -1.06185793 -0.2872822 -0.6655179 0.40335533 ## 6 0.5234630 -0.94372291 -0.2872822 -0.6655179 0.55847261 ## rainfall wind residual1 residual2 temperature:rainfall individual ## 1 -0.4787747 -0.4815074 -0.9622622 -0.01356718 -0.01539221 1 ## 2 0.5679376 0.2375696 0.2777184 -0.05167259 -0.04725466 1 ## 3 -0.4349687 -0.8358394 1.5151691 0.45918672 0.12482338 1 ## 4 -0.1022663 0.1218843 1.4407051 -0.44064937 -0.19704515 1 ## 5 0.9295396 -0.7546885 -0.7990423 -0.13308504 0.37493476 1 ## 6 -1.2836502 -1.3774485 1.2731618 -0.83189771 -0.71688346 1 ## squid_pop ## 1 1 ## 2 1 ## 3 1 ## 4 1 ## 5 1 ## 6 1 # library(MCMCglmm) # mod &lt;- MCMCglmm(cbind(y1,y2)~1,random=~us(trait):individual, rcov=~us(trait):units,data=data,family=rep(&quot;gaussian&quot;,2),verbose=FALSE) # summary(mod) "],["3.2-one-response-repeatedly-measured-the-other-not.html", "3.2 One response repeatedly measured, the other not", " 3.2 One response repeatedly measured, the other not In some circumstances we might want to simulate two responses, one that varies between measurements and one that doesn’t.

The simplest way to do this is providing a pedigree using the the pedigree argument (a genetic relatedness matrix could also be given to the cov_str argument). The input to this argument needs to be a list, and the name of the pedigree in the list links it with the item in the parameter list. NOTE the simulate_population function has very little error checking of pedigree structure at the moment When simulating breeding values, all individuals in pedigree need to be in the data_structure and vice versa.

Lets take the example of maternal genetic effects. The maternal genetic effect that affects an individual’s phenotype, is that of its mother, not itself. Here we can use [] to index the levels of the random effects within the formula. We need to be careful here as internally in simulate_population() the indexing of the factors in the data structure is done independently. We therefore need to generate a index for the mothers that links to the individual. We can do this using the index_link argument - in the code below we create a new factor to index with, called dam_link, that is the dam factor in our data structure, that has been indexed to match the animal factor. Using this indexing trick, we can simulate the direct genetic and maternal genetic effects that an individual has (and the covariance between them), as well as generating an individual’s phenotype from its own direct genetic effects, and its mother’s maternal genetic effect. squid_data &lt;- simulate_population( parameters=list( animal = list( names=c(&quot;direct&quot;,&quot;maternal&quot;), vcov = matrix(c(1,0.3,0.3,0.5),2,2) ), residual = list( names=&quot;residual&quot;, vcov = 0.5 ) ), data_structure=BTped, pedigree=list(animal=BTped), index_link=list(dam_link=&quot;dam-animal&quot;), model = &quot;y = direct + maternal[dam_link] + residual&quot; ) ## Warning in FUN(X[[i]], ...): Not all levels are of dam are present in animal ## meaning that there will be NAs in the new grouping factor data &lt;- get_population_data(squid_data) head(data) ## y direct maternal residual animal dam sire squid_pop ## 1 NA -1.1765364 -0.33246522 0.98593948 R187557 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; 1 ## 2 NA 1.0032654 0.17594714 0.46289797 R187559 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; 1 ## 3 NA -1.3823286 -0.43613248 -0.89167875 R187568 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; 1 ## 4 NA 0.3973638 -0.07201462 0.16249743 R187518 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; 1 ## 5 NA -1.2407912 -0.56117955 -0.01929683 R187528 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; 1 ## 6 NA 0.6117901 0.45613335 1.49005498 R187945 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; 1 "],["4.5-gxe.html", "4.5 GxE", " 4.5 GxE Coming soon… "],["4.6-dominance.html", "4.6 Dominance", " 4.6 Dominance Coming soon… "],["4.7-inbreeding-depression.html", "4.7 Inbreeding depression", " 4.7 Inbreeding depression Coming soon… "],["4.8-genetic-groups.html", "4.8 Genetic Groups", " 4.8 Genetic Groups Coming soon… "],["5-phylogenetic.html", "5 Phylogenetic Effects", " 5 Phylogenetic Effects Coming Soon "],["6-temporal-and-spatial-effects.html", "6 Temporal and Spatial Effects ", " 6 Temporal and Spatial Effects "],["6.1-simple-temporal-effects.html", "6.1 Simple Temporal Effects", " 6.1 Simple Temporal Effects We might have measured a variable over the course of a certain time period (e.g. 20 years). We might expect that there is stochastic year-to-year variation, which we can simulate already. However we might also want to simulate patterns in that temporal data. We can treat the levels associated with a particular grouping factor (e.g. year) as both a factor and continuous.

The param input is a matrix with (named) columns. The rows of this matrix represent different sampling sets. This is most easily put together using the cbind() (column bind) function, specifying the names. The number of repeat observations for a higher level can be specified using name ‘observation’ (this doesn’t have to exist in the data structure).
